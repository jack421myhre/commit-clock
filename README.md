## Description
As I find my workflow on a project, I seem to always forget to commit often. This tool solves that issue by setting 60 minute work intervals where an audible alert will play to remind the user that it's time to commit.

## Deployment
https://jack421myhre.github.io/commit-clock/
## Motivations
I found that heavy, well intended focus within a select period of time to be beneficial to an overall work flow. Taking breaks after defined intervals, where the sole focus is work, undistracted, I found yields great results in productivity. This tool is meant to help structure this productive work, lining up with a project, and git commit based expectation during this bootcamp. I hope that this tool provides you with a learning structure leading to nothing short of success. 
## Installation
None required.
## Usage 
Load the page in your browser and start the timer by clicking the button. Pressing the 'Stop Timer' button will reset the clock, so only stop it when you mean it! This is designed to keep the user focused and free from distractions.
